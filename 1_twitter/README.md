## 1. Design a Scalable Twitter Clone in the Cloud

### Imagine you are tasked with building a basic Twitter clone in the cloud (using GCP or another cloud platform).
#### ● Define a Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Start by outlining a basic set of features that you would include in a minimal version of the application. What core functionality must be supported?

#### ● Identify Required Cloud Resources: Describe the cloud resources you would use to build and deploy this MVP. How would you connect and configure them?`

#### ● Scaling Strategy: After launching the MVP, explain how you would scale the system to handle growing user traffic. What resources or architectural changes would be necessary for scaling?

#### ● Additional Features & Considerations: As the application grows, new features might be added. Discuss any potential additional features and the cloud resources you would need to support them.

#### ● Key Questions: What critical questions would you need to address as you plan the system’s architecture and scaling strategy?
